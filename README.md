# E-commerce Data Analysis: Unveiling Consumer Behaviour 

## Description

The online purchase and sale of products and services is known as electronic commerce, or e-commerce. Retail, consumer goods, travel, and hospitality are just a few of the many businesses that make up this quickly expanding sector of the global economy. The way we purchase has been completely transformed by e-commerce, but have you ever pondered what insights may be gleaned from the massive volumes of data produced by these transactions? 

This dataset isn't authentic. Python's Faker module was used to create this dataset exclusively for educational purposes. Dataset is downloaded from kaggle.
